# wordGame
An interactive name game played against the computer, where each player has to say a name that begins with the last letter of the previous name.
Each player has 8 seconds to come up with a name. There is a 30% chance that the computer won't be able to find a name.
The game is over when players fail to come up with a name within the given time frame, or say a name that was said before.
Most preferred names by the computer: 'Emma, Emily, Abby, Amy, Yoko, Niki, Nicole, Hope, Ingrid, Irene' (for some reason)
Good luck!
